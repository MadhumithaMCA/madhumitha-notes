gpio is used for:
     reading digital signal
     issuing interrupt
     generating triggervfor external component

gpio pin -  generic pin which value consists of one of two voltage setting
gpio port - platforms defined grouping of gpio pins(stm32 16 pins)

to connect many pins the multiplexing method is used 
pins such as(urt pins ,i2c,spc) each consists of two pins multiplexing is used to connect all these pins.

after reset  the default gpio pins are in input mode

gpio input mode

default gpio pin will be in

ic state - unpredictable state or floating state
neither high state (1) or ground state(0)

keeping pins in high state leads to excess power consumption

gpio output mode

output will be in open drain state

open drain state -0
push/pull configuration
